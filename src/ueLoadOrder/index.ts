/**
 * A lightweight _experimental_ wrapper/helper API over the FBLO API (in Vortex 1.4+), designed for use in UE4-based games.
 * 
 * Slightly simplifies registering and configuring Vortex's load order management for games using the "default" UE4 mod loading behaviour.
 * 
 * Import types from this module using 
 * ```typescript
 * import { LoadOrderHelper } from "vortex-ext-common/ueLoadOrder";
 * ```
 * 
 * @remarks Please note that the majority of this code was adapted from the guide provided by @IDCs [here](https://github.com/Nexus-Mods/vortex-api/issues/22)
